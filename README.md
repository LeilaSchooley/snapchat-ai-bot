# Snapchat Bot for Product Promotion

## Overview

This project aims to develop a bot for Snapchat to promote and sell a product. The bot will automatically add thousands of Snapchat users and send them promotional snaps to expand the reach of our product. The process involves:

1. Spamming users with a snap offering the product/offer.
2. Providing a payment platform (crypto).
3. Delivering the product once the payment is made.

## Features

- **User Addition:** Automatically adds thousands of Snapchat users.
- **Promotion:** Sends promotional snaps to the added users.
- **Payment Integration:** Supports cryptocurrency payments.
- **Automated Delivery:** Ensures the product is delivered once the payment is received.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `uiautomator2` library
- Snapchat account

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snapchat-bot.git
   cd snapchat-bot
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure your Snapchat credentials:**

   Edit the `config.json` file to include your Snapchat login credentials and other necessary configurations.

   ```json
   {
     "username": "your_snapchat_username",
     "password": "your_snapchat_password",
     "crypto_wallet": "your_crypto_wallet_address"
   }
   ```

## Usage

1. **Start the bot:**

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Monitor the bot's activity:**

   The bot will log its actions and any encountered issues in `bot.log`. Check this file regularly to ensure everything is running smoothly.

3. **Handling payments:**

   Ensure your crypto wallet is configured correctly to receive payments. The bot will verify transactions and send the product to the user upon successful payment.

## Important Notes

- **Compliance:** Ensure your activities comply with Snapchat's terms of service and local regulations regarding spam and unsolicited messaging.
- **Security:** Keep your credentials and payment information secure. Do not hardcode sensitive data in your scripts.
- **Maintenance:** Regularly update the bot to adapt to any changes in Snapchat's API or app updates.
